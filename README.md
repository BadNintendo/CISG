### CheckersModule Explanation

#### Purpose:
This module evaluates and suggests the top 5 best moves in a checkers game, aiming to lead to the fewest moves to win. It also includes rules to detect draw scenarios, which are applied only when relevant conditions are met.

#### Initialization:
- **Class Setup**: The `CheckersModule` class initializes with basic settings, including:
  - `self.data_store`: A dictionary to store data.
  - `self.move_counter`: To track the number of non-capture moves.
  - `self.repetitions`: To track board positions for 2-fold repetition.
  - `self.moves_printed`: To track if the moves have already been printed for this evaluation.

#### Core Methods:

1. **evaluate_moves**: Calculates the top 5 possible moves for the player's pieces, considering both basic moves and jumps, and applying known championship strategies.
   
   - **DIRECTIONS**: The pieces can move in four possible directions on the 8x8 board: -9, -7, 7, and 9. These directions account for the board's layout and the way pieces move diagonally.
   
   - **is_valid_move(pos)**: Checks if a move is within the board boundaries and if the destination position is empty.
   
   - **opponent_threat_analysis(pos, opponent_pieces, board)**: Analyzes potential threats posed by opponent pieces to a given position.
     - `threat_score`: A variable to calculate the threat level. 
     - **THREAT_DIRECTIONS**: Possible directions opponent can move/jump.
     
   - **championship_moves(moves)**: Boosts the scores of moves that align with known optimal strategies.
   
   - **Move Evaluation**:
     - Checks if the destination position for a move is valid (within bounds and empty). If valid, a move is added to the list with a score of 1.
     - Checks if a piece can jump over an opponent's piece and verifies that the position after the jump is valid. If valid, it calculates the risk score and adds a jump move with a calculated score.
   
   - **Sorting and Selecting Moves**:
     - All possible moves are collected and sorted by score, from highest to lowest.
     - The top 5 moves are selected as the best options, ensuring that each move is from a different piece.
     
   - **Printing Moves**:
     - If moves have not been printed yet, the top 5 moves are printed, displaying details of each move. The `self.moves_printed` flag is set to `True`.

2. **reset_print_flag**: Resets the print flag to allow re-evaluation and printing of moves.

3. **detect_draw**: Detects draw scenarios based on the 50-move rule and the 2-fold repetition rule, which only applies when one piece is left.
   - **50-Move Rule**: Checks if 50 moves have passed without a capture, resulting in a draw, only if one piece is left.
   - **2-Fold Repetition Rule**: Checks if the same board position has occurred twice, but only applies when one piece is left, resulting in a draw.
   
#### Execution:
- **Initialization**: The board is set up with initial positions for player and opponent pieces.
- **Evaluating Moves**: The `evaluate_moves` method is called to determine the best possible moves.
- **Detecting Draws**: The `detect_draw` method is called to check for draw scenarios.
- **Switching Sides**: The player and opponent pieces can be switched for the opponent's turn (currently commented out for simplicity).

#### Example:
```python
board = [None] * 64
player_pieces = [11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18]  # Player pieces initial positions
opponent_pieces = [47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54]  # Opponent pieces initial positions

checkers = CheckersModule()

for _ in range(100):  # Simulate moves
    best_moves = checkers.evaluate_moves(board, player_pieces, opponent_pieces)
    is_draw, draw_reason = checkers.detect_draw(board, player_pieces, opponent_pieces)

    if is_draw:
        print(f"{CheckersModule.COLOR_CYAN}{draw_reason}{CheckersModule.COLOR_RESET}")
        break

    # Switch sides (for simplicity, the same evaluation can be applied to opponent)
    ##player_pieces, opponent_pieces = opponent_pieces, player_pieces
    ##board = board[::-1]  # Mirror the board for the opponent's turn
```
